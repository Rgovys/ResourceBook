This is an online reference resource by the RGovys community. It includes a wide variety of loosely curated information from different community members. It is place to document institutional knowledge and provide references to available resources. The Resource Book is modeled off the NOAA Fisheries Open Science [Resource Book](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/ResourceBook/). Please see that book for more helpful resources for R users in government.
