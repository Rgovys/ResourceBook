## Citation

There are a few registered agencies that can register DOIs with DOI.org. The big one for science is [DataCite](https://datacite.org) and you can see the [organizations and institutions](https://datacite.org/members.html) that are members of DataCite. NOAA is a member so if there were a software release program, one could get a DOI through that. That is how some USGS software is released and DOI generated. But [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is probably most common for GitHub products and has GitHub integration now so that archiving and DOI generation can be automated when you create a release on GitHub.

If your work is something people cite, like a report or a software package, add a `CITATION.md` file or add citation information to the `Readme.md` file. You can create a [DOI](https://github.com/Openscapes/2021-noaa-nmfs/wiki/8-DOIs) for software. Not all repositories are things that someone would cite however so this is not something one always adds.

## Examples

Here are examples of DOIs created for agency software products

* [EPA CMAQ](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ) creates DOIs for the software releases on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5213949#.YTzXW1NuejA)
* EPA CMAQ creates data DOIs for the CMAQ simulation output on [Dataverse](https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15139/S3/PDE4SS)
* USGS releases software and generate DOIs for its software. Example the DOI for [groundmotion](https://github.com/usgs/groundmotion-processing) is generated by USGS Software Releases.

### Zenodo 

A public GitHub repository is an option but not completely ideal as the code may change and GitHub may not be around forever. Therefore, proper archives such as Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) are preferable.

Note Zenodo has [GitHub integration](https://help.zenodo.org/) for archiving your GitHub releases.

### Socrata 

Socrata also has publicly accessible archived data with a permanent record. You can contact your NOAA database manager to discuss options for archiving additional data. 

### Badges

Here is examples of code to add to your `Readme.md` to get the DOI badges. Edit the DOI and svg urls to that for your DOI.

## Derivation work and use

In some cases, you might want to add a statement about "fair use" and "fair attribution" to your repo. That really depends on what the repo is about. I tend to add this when I am sharing teaching material and I want to be clear that it is fine to copy the repo material and re-work it for other uses.
